This page has nothing to do with the Illinois based American company, Gemini Computer Systems, nor the Google AI product.

## Introduction

The Gemini computers were made by Gemini Microcomputers Ltd., later Gemini Computer Systems of Great Britain, in the early to mid 80s. Their early models were built around the Zilog Z80A processor, but one model - the *Gemini Challenger* was based on Motorola's 68020 processor. The company was started by John A. Marshall, who previously headed Nasco Sales Ltd, famous for the  [Nascom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nascom) computer line. The Nascom and Gemini computers are supposedly compatible to some extent.

I have been fortunate enough to inherit [a collection of Gemini computers and peripherals](./Collection).
