## Introduction

The Gemini computers were made by Gemini Microcomputers Ltd., later Gemini Computer Systems of Great Britain, in the early to mid 80s. Their early models were built around the Zilog Z80A processor, but one model - the *Gemini Challenger* was based on Motorola's 68020 processor. The company was started by John A. Marshall, who previously headed Nasco Sales Ltd, famous for the  [Nascom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nascom) computer line. The Nascom and Gemini computers are supposedly compatible to some extent.

I was introduced to these computers when I was around 8 or 9 years old. My father imported and sold computers from Great Britain, and had his heart set on the Gemini. They were resold and used througout his workshop, and I was encouraged to dive into the world of software development at an early age. As the Gemini started to phase out, I was gifted several machines, but I lost interest over time. Recently my father passed away, and I inherited his somewhat neglected collection of Gemini computers.

I will add to this repository as I work on reparing and renovating these computers. They are somewhat rare, and deserve some attention.
