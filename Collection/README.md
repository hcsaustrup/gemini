# My Gemini Collection

## Introduction

I was introduced to these computers when I was around 8 or 9 years old. My father imported and sold computers from Great Britain, and had his heart set on the Gemini. They were resold and used througout his workshop, and I was encouraged to dive into the world of software development at an early age. As the Gemini started to phase out, I was gifted several machines, but I lost interest over time. Recently my father passed away, and I inherited his somewhat neglected collection of Gemini computers.

I will add to this repository as I work on reparing and renovating these computers. They are somewhat rare, and deserve some attention.
